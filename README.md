# One Smart Control Desktop Software  

We recommend to download the official offline installer. Unzip the package and run the **OneSmartControlDesktopInstaller.exe** to install the application on your Windows 10 system (64 bit). A few steps later you can find a new entry in your start-menu. Launch the One Smart Control Desktop Application and have some fun with Delta-Robot One. We recommend a screen with a minimum of 1600x900 pixels to display the application in full size.

# Overview and short introduction

One Smart Control Desktop provides control functions for Delta-Robot One using One Easy Protocol. The control functions for moving, light and gripper actions are docked on the left side of this software. **Attention: If a robot is connected the commands run directly!** All commands can be stored in the implemented programming chart (flowchart) using the "to chart" button on the top right side of a control widget. The center of this application contains a visualisation of the robot workingspace. Below this workingspace widget are some buttons to etablish a connection to your Delta-Robot One. You are able to scan the COM ports of you device. All connected COM devices will be listetd after a scan is finished. Choose a port to connect a robot with the connect button. The software checks the connection with a handshake. If there is no robot on the port available an information screen pops up. On the right side of this software a flowchart represents a robot program (here prefilled). The toolbar below the chart provides add, change and delete functions. You can run, save or load a program using this toolbar.

At this image the robots tool center point (TCP) is moved to the right side means positive y-axis. The Gripper is closed (blue TCP) and the green light of the robot is enabled with full intensity. The TCP is near the workingspace limit. The reachable position (x,y) depends on the z-axis. The workingspace is splitted in some levels which are displayed on the vectical scale near the working area. The outside area (filled with pattern) is not reachable at the actual workingspace level.
